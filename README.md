- 👋 Hi, I'm @uniAIDevs
- 👀 I’m interested in making AI interfaces accessible for all. I am the owner of the underground tech firm UnityAI. (No, not the game making platform.)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, and making Gradio apps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating MongoDB databases for AI apps.
- 📫 How to reach me... (please don't sue me for my email) russia@hackermail.com, or reach out to my personal email: namelessonbandlab@gmail.com (I'm also a music producer.) You can also use the contact form below.
- 😄 Pronouns: He, him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love creating music! I'm an experienced music producer, at the age of just 13. Reach out to me if you are a more knowledgeable AI developer who has worked on projects similar to Riffusion, Suno AI, or Soundful. I would love to know more about these technologies.
